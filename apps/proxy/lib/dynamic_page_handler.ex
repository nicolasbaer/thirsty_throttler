  inititalize a plain HTTP handler.  See the documentation here:

  All cowboy HTTP handlers require an init() function, identifies which
  type of handler this is and returns an initial state (if the handler
  maintains state).  In a plain http handler, you just return a
  3-tuple with :ok.  We don't need to track a  state in this handler, so
  we're returning the atom :no_state.
